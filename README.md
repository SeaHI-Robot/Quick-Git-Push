## Notice!

As shown blow, the git commit format is fixed, so **do not use this script in projects with strict commit format requirements.**



Inside `quick_git_push.sh`, as a reference to the commit message:

```bash
......

# Get date from your computer system
today=$(date +"%y.%m.%d")

# execute git commit
git commit -m "update $today"

......
```
